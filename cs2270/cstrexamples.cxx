	//Now I'm going to copy testString2 into testString3
	//strlen does not count the '\0' character so I have to 
	//do the length of testString2+1

	//Now I'll compare these two strings using strcmp
	//http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/?kw=strcmp
	//IMPORTANT: RETURNS 0 IF THEY ARE EQUAL!!!
	//Returns an integral value indicating the relationship between the strings:
//A zero value indicates that both strings are equal.
//A value greater than zero indicates that the first character that does not match has a greater value in str1 than in str2; 
//And a value less than zero indicates the opposite.
